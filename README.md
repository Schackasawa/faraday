<h2>Project Faraday: Circuit Simulation in Virtual Reality</h2>

Project Faraday is an experiment in virtual reality education, allowing anyone with a virtual reality headset to explore basic circuit design and develop an intuition for the way electricity behaves in the real world. Beginners of all ages can benefit from the ability to combine any number of wires, motors, bulbs and switches to construct arbitrarily complex experiments. Unlike traditional classroom education, virtual reality allows the student to visualize electron flow and its effects on various components in an accessible and fun environment, hopefully encouraging natural exploration and hands-on learning.

<h3>Technology</h3>

This project uses the Unity game engine, Unity's XR integration framework, and <a href="https://spicesharp.github.io/SpiceSharp/index.html">SpiceSharp</a>, a freely available open source circuit simulation library. The code has been developed and tested extensively on the Meta(Oculus) Rift headset and Touch controllers, but because it uses Unity's XR framework rather than proprietary Meta APIs, it can be easily adapted to other headsets and controllers as well.

<h3>Author</h3>

All code outside of the SpiceSharp library has been written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dschack/">Darren Schack</a>, a Seattle-based full stack software engineer with a passion for technology and a particular interest in virtual reality.
